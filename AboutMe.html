    <section class="About">
        <p><h1>About Me:</h1></p>
        <p>
            My name is Enyetullah Rahimullah, and I am an aspiring programmer. I am a 21-year-old University Junior, currently studying at Truman State University where I 
            am completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
            While it may sound cliche, I love Computer Science, especially programming. What captivates me the most in this field is the ability to create something out of nothing
            like an alchemist. Slowly, I am further developing not only my wisdom on the subject, but my practical skills as well by applying the concepts I am learning in real-world 
            scenario projects such as making a Word Document app for most physically disabled people. Truly, it is a wonderful field with tons of potential, which I hope to explore 
            throughout my career. 
        </p>

        <!-- Education Section -->
        <p id="headers">Education:</p>
        <p>
            As stated above, I am currently completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Truman State University. I currently have a 4.0 GPA and have completed two years worth
            of my degree. Half way there! 
        </p>

        <!-- Languages Spoken Section -->
        <p id="headers">Languages Spoken:</p>
        <p>
            I speak several languages. My native language is Dari, a language spoken in Afghanistan. It is almost identical to Persian/ Farsi, the language spoken in Iran. I can speak English
            as well which you might have guessed by reading this. Finally, I can also speak Urdu as well as Hindi as they are both similarly spoken. So, I can speak 5 or 3 different
            languages depending on how one might view it.
        </p>

        <!-- Work Experience Section -->
        <p id="headers">Work Experience:</p>
        <p>
            I have managed to gain some extremely valuable real life job experience over the past two years of living here in the United States. I worked as a student worker for Sodexo for over a year. That allowed me to 
            experience and understand what a fast-paced working environment truly feels like. I also understood the importance of customer service in this job, as only by managing the products correctly and adopting a calm and
            patient demeanor can one truly excel in their job.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am working as an ID Office Worker as well as an International Ambassador for the university. Both jobs have been extremely crucial in further understanding how a professional working environment works, especially the ID job.
            The experience that both jobs have given me in understanding how an office job works, the way to handle "difficult customers" and the patience and commitment required to the art of an office job has been truly wonderful.
        </p>

        <!-- Skills Section -->
        <p id="headers">Skills:</p>
        <p>
            Currently, I have experience in coding in C++, Python, Java, HTML and CSS. I found making apps using Android Studio to be a delight as well as an excellent way to improve my skills further. I also became interested in the 
            working of websites, so I also started exploring and understanding how websites are made and applied those concepts, which you can see by his very website that I made myself.
        </p>

        <!-- Personal Touch Section -->
        <p id="headers">Personal Touch:</p>
        <p>
            I love sports, especially watching them. I am completely smitten by Football(Soccer) and Cricket. I also love gaming and watching animated shows, both American and Japanese. My favorite anime is, though kind of cliche, Dragon Ball Z
            and my favorite American animated TV series is the owl house. 
        </p>
